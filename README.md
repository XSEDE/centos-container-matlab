# centos-container-matlab
This repo contains files necessary to build a container with CentOS and Matlab Container Runtime to be used in the XSEDE compute environment. 

This repo can be cloned as a template and used as a starting point for containerizing 
applications that require Matlab Container Runtime.

For a *very* simple example, see: https://github.com/XSEDE/centos-container-matlab/mdimensionalarray
